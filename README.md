## **Abstract :**
        Agriculture plays a major role in the economic development of India, therefore we need to carry out new technologies for Precision Agriculture. Manual method for soil analysis gives inaccurate value because there is a difference between soil samples at the field and measuring in the laboratory with technologies. In India, it is required automated distribution of fertilizers and technologies. Because most of the farmers using traditional types of farming which gives less amount of productivity with respect to efforts. The productivity of India is less as compared to other countries. To enhance productivity and profit margin, the adaptation of new technologies can help us to a great extent. So, this paper based on a survey of Wireless Sensor Network because these technologies useful for precision of agriculture. This paper presents the study of Wireless Sensor Network that can be applied in agriculture for automated farming. This will help the end-users like farmers to make the right decision, gain better yield, and economic advantage.

## **Introduction :**

         Soil Analysis is one of the valuable tools in the Agriculture field for yielding good crop. Soil Analysis helps farmers to determine the values of nutrients needed for efficient and economical production. Most Soil usually has a very high supply of nutrients. But whenever new crop gets harvested the nutrients in the soil get used for crops. Because low nutrition growth of crops doesnâ€™t happen properly. To get better proper crop yield, the nutrients must be restored in the soil. Hence farmers need to know the right proportion of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). 

        In the 21st century, Farmers need to use precision farming to improve their crop yields. To calculate the ratio of NPK we are using the Wireless Sensor Network nodes. These notes are placed at a specific distance so we can get precise calculations of NPK values. But for big farms, we will need a very large number of nodes. So, to overcome this problem we are using the cubic spline method. which is a type of interpolation. In this, we can estimate a method of constructing new data points within the range of the discrete set of known data points. By this method, we can reduce the nodes so it will be economical for farmers.

## **WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK**
        Wireless Sensor Network is an emerging technology that helps the development of precision agriculture. WSN comprises of sensors and micro-controllers to process the data, battery or source of powers, base station to transmit the data. Recent trends and advancements in WSN technology have carved the path for the development of less cost. Low consumption of power and multi-functioning sensor nodes. Sensor node deployed at different places senses the different environmental parameters at that place and the processes the data accordingly. Sensor nodes can monitor parameters like soil fertility, temperature, humidity, moisture, etc. WSN has a wide range of applications in fields of agriculture, military, industries. In the agricultural field, WSN can be used for real-time monitoring of data on the field. In our case, it is to monitor the NPK fertilizer values.

 ## **NPK Fertilizers :**
        The plant uses three macro-nutrients nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P), potassium(K) that is NPK, nitrogen n is responsible for the growth of leaves on the plant. Phosphorus is responsible for root growth and flower and fruit development. Potassium is a nutrient that helps the overall functions of the plant perform correctly. Knowing the NPK value of the soil will help in calculating the optimal value of the fertilizer required.

## **Architecture Design :**
 
         In given fig, we are using two master nodes and four slave nodes and one base station. Each master node connects to two slave nodes. the slave nodes of master node M1 called M1S1, M1S2 and other slave nodes of Master M2 are called M2S1 and M2S2. All slave nodes send data to their respective master node M1 and M2 for Sensing, collecting, storing, and processing the sensed data and then transmitting that data to the appropriate base station.
